# web_scraping
scraping of a HTML page with Beautiful Soup. 

As Mitchell states, Web Scraping is the collection of data with any method other than using APIs or web browsers and most of the time is done by writing a script that automatically ask for data, gets it and then goes through it to separate the information of interest (2018). In this project, a simple script in python is used to parse a specific webpage and extract all the unique links that relocate to an HTML page, and then writes this links into a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file.
